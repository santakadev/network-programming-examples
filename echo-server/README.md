Node.js echo server
===================

## Running the echo server

```sh
node src/index.js
```

## Connecting to the echo server

Connect to the server with

```sh
nc -v 127.0.0.1 8000
```

When the connection is established you can start sending
messages to the server. I'll respond the same message back.
